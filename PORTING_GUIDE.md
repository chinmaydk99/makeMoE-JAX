# Porting Sparse MoE from PyTorch to JAX: A Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

This document details the process of porting the Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) language model from PyTorch to JAX/Flax. The original implementation was based on Andrej Karpathy's makemore project, and we've successfully adapted it to leverage JAX's functional programming paradigm and JIT compilation capabilities.

## Key Differences Between PyTorch and JAX

### 1. Functional vs Object-Oriented Programming

**PyTorch (Object-Oriented):**
```python
class Expert(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, n_embed):
        super().__init__()
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(n_embed, 4 * n_embed),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(4 * n_embed, n_embed),
            nn.Dropout(dropout),
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.net(x)
```

**JAX/Flax (Functional):**
```python
class Expert(nn.Module):
    n_embd: int
    dropout_rate: float = 0.1

    @nn.compact
    def __call__(self, x, training: bool = True):
        x = nn.Dense(4 * self.n_embd, name="w1")(x)
        x = nn.relu(x)
        x = nn.Dense(self.n_embd, name="w2")(x)
        x = nn.Dropout(rate=self.dropout_rate, deterministic=not training)(x)
        return x
```

### 2. Parameter Management

**PyTorch:** Parameters are stored as attributes and automatically tracked.

**JAX/Flax:** Parameters are separated from the model definition and passed explicitly:
```python
# Initialize parameters
params = model.init(rng_key, dummy_input)

# Apply model
output = model.apply(params, input_data)
```

### 3. Random Number Generation

**PyTorch:** Uses global random state or manual seeding.

**JAX:** Uses explicit random keys that must be split and passed:
```python
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
key1, key2 = jax.random.split(key)
```

## Major Porting Challenges and Solutions

### 1. JIT Compilation Compatibility

**Problem:** The original implementation used `jnp.where` with dynamic shapes, which is incompatible with JAX's JIT compilation:

```python
# Original problematic code
token_indices = jnp.where(expert_mask)
batch_idx, seq_idx = token_indices
```

**Solution:** Avoided dynamic shapes by processing full tensors with masking:

```python
# JIT-compatible solution
for expert_idx in range(self.num_experts):
    expert_mask = jnp.any(router_indices == expert_idx, axis=-1)
    expert_weight = router_weights[:, :, expert_idx]
    
    expert_output = self.experts[expert_idx](x, training=training)
    weighted_output = expert_output * expert_weight[:, :, None]
    masked_output = weighted_output * expert_mask[:, :, None]
    
    final_output = final_output + masked_output
```

### 2. Attention Mechanism Adaptation

**PyTorch Version:**
```python
wei = wei.masked_fill(self.tril[:T, :T] == 0, float('-inf'))
```

**JAX Version:**
```python
mask = jnp.tril(jnp.ones((T_use, T_use)))
mask = jnp.broadcast_to(mask, (B, T_use, T_use))
wei = jnp.where(mask, wei, -jnp.inf)
```

### 3. Router Implementation

**Key Changes:**
- Used `jax.lax.top_k` instead of `torch.topk`
- Replaced `torch.scatter` with `jnp.put_along_axis`
- Explicit random key management for noise generation

### 4. Training Loop Restructuring

**PyTorch:** Uses automatic differentiation with `.backward()`

**JAX:** Uses functional transformations:
```python
@jax.jit
def train_step(state, batch, dropout_rng):
    def loss_fn(params):
        logits, loss = state.apply_fn(params, batch['tokens'], ...)
        return loss, logits
    
    (loss, logits), grads = jax.value_and_grad(loss_fn, has_aux=True)(state.params)
    state = state.apply_gradients(grads=grads)
    return state, {'loss': loss, 'perplexity': jnp.exp(loss)}
```

## Architecture Components

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. JIT Compilation
All training functions are JIT-compiled for faster execution:
```python
@jax.jit
def train_step(state, batch, dropout_rng):
    # Training logic here
```

### 2. Vectorized Operations
Instead of loops over individual tokens, we process batches:
```python
# Process all experts simultaneously with masking
for expert_idx in range(self.num_experts):
    expert_output = self.experts[expert_idx](x, training=training)
    # Apply routing weights and masks
```

## Conclusion

The JAX implementation successfully captures all the functionality of the original PyTorch version while providing:
- Better performance through JIT compilation
- Improved modularity and maintainability
- Type safety and better error handling
- Functional programming benefits

The key insight was avoiding dynamic shapes in the MoE routing mechanism, which required restructuring the expert selection logic to be JIT-compatible while maintaining the same semantic behavior.

This implementation serves as a solid foundation for further research and development in sparse mixture of experts models using JAX/Flax.
